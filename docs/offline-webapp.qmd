- Healthcare workers have access to Android tablets
- Internet access is intermittent at point of care. Assume that healthcare worker has access to internet when she/he takes tablet home
- Presenting results from data analytics needs to have solution for synchronization/offline usage

- This impacts the following elements in the reference architecture
  - Data visualization and user interaciton
  - Development, Engineering and DevOps: capability to deploy Svelte apps on and hosted app platform
  - Standards: compatibility with D3.js ecosystem for building interactive data visualizations. Vega-lite is standard is used in this component, and is also available in the workbench

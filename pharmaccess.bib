This study uses the Technology, Organisation and Environment (TOE) framework to examine the preparedness of health facilities of the Christian Health Association of Ghana (CHAG) to implement a digital mobile health insurance claims processing software (CLAIM-it), which aims to increase efficiency. Methods The study used a cross-sectional mixed method design to collect data (technology and human capital capacity and baseline operational performance of claims management) from a sample of 20 CHAG health facilities across Ghana. While quantitative data was analysed using simple descriptive statistics statistics (frequencies, mean, minimum and maximum values), qualitative interviews were recorded, transcribed and abstracted into two major themes that were reported to re-enforce the quantitative findings. Results The quantitative results revealed challenges including inadequate computers and accessories, adequate numbers and skills for claims processing, poor intranets and internet access, absence of a robust post-implementation support system and inadequate standard operating procedures (SOPs) for seamless automation of claims processing. In addition to the above, the qualitative results emphasised the need to make CLAIM-it more flexible and capable of being integrated into third-party softwares. Notwithstanding the challenges, decision-makers in CHAG health facilities see the CLAIM-it software as having better functionality and superior capabilities compared to existing claims processing systems in Ghana. Conclusion Notwithstanding the challenges, the CLAIM-it software is more likely to be adopted by decision-makers, given the positive perception in terms of superior functionality. It is important that key actors in claims management at the National Health Insurance collaborate with relevant stakeholders to adopt the CLAIM-it software for claims processing and management in Ghana.},

FHIR enables data interoperability as it is based on lightweight open source RESTful services. Many developed countries which already running electronic health record systems are now focused on the adoption of FHIR to unlock its potential benefits by integrating other technologies like Substitutable Medical Applications, Reusable Technology (SMART) platform. In most of the developing countries electronic health record system does not exist because they lag in resources to invest in electronic health record systems and they are still operating on paper-based health record system, so they are unable to adopt FHIR and other related technologies like SMART. Due to which, interoperability is not enabled on this paper-based data. These countries remain at a distance from the benefits of FHIR and SMART platform to provide better patient care to their patients, quick and efficient clinical decision making and better diagnostics. This paper presents the implementation of SMART on FHIR in healthcare organizations of developing countries through a proposed framework SFPBRF which not only maps paper-based health record system's data to HL7's FHIR standard but also integrate the complete SMART on FHIR platform to run SMART apps on this FHIR conformed data. This paper presents successful translation (done by translation engine) of paper-based data to HL7 FHIR standard. It also shows the running of open source and internally developed SMART apps on this FHIR conformed data. Thus, by the successful mapping and implementation of SMART on FHIR through proposed framework SFPBRF we can conclude that FHIR can be adopted in healthcare organizations of developing countries and SMART on FHIR can help a lot in achieving better patient care, quick and efficient decision making and better diagnostics in developing countries.},

By rendering data as technical entities, digital technologies transform the process of knowing and the knowledge functions data fulfil in socioeconomic life. These functions are most of the times mediated by putting together disperse and steadily updatable data in more stable entities we refer to as data objects. Users, customers, products, and physical machines rendered as data objects become the technical and cognitive means through which organizational knowledge, patterns, and practices develop. Such conditions loosen the dependence of data from domain knowledge, reorder the relative significance of internal versus external references in organizations, and contribute to a paradigmatic contemporary development that we identify with the decentering of organizations of which digital platforms are an important specimen.},

  abstract = {Background: In concert with international commitments, the Government of Kenya identified universal health coverage (UHC) as one of its four priority agenda to enable its populations have access to health care without financial duress. Nevertheless, only about 19.5\% of the Kenyan population is enrolled in any insurance health cover. Since 2016, Amref Health Africa and PharmAccess Foundation have been implementing the innovative partnership on universal and sustainable healthcare (iPUSH) programme in Navakholo sub-county of Kakamega County. The objective of this study is to examine ownership of health insurance cover among women of reproductive age (WRA) in Navakholo sub-county, Kakamega County. Methods: We analysed data captured during household registration conducted in February 2021. The dataset consisted of a total of 148,957 household members within 32,262 households, 310 villages, and 32 community health units. The data had been collected using mobile phones by trained community health volunteers (CHVs) and transmitted using the Amref electronic data management platform and reposited in a server. After much review of data quality, variables qualifying were analysed through descriptive and causal methods using STATA software. Results: Insurance coverage in Navakholo sub-county stood at 11\% among women aged 15-49 years who were either spouses of the head of household or heads of households themselves. This is much lower than the national aggregate reported from sample surveys, but higher than the 7\% found in the same survey for the Western region where Navakholo is situated. Social determinant variables \textendash{} age, perceived condition of the household, and wealth ranking \textendash{} are highly significant in the relationship with ownership of health insurance cover while measures of reproductive health and health vulnerability are not. Conclusions: In Navakholo sub-county of western Kenya, health insurance coverage is lower than the national aggregate estimated from sample surveys. Age, perception of household condition, and wealth ranking are very significantly related to ownership of a health insurance cover. Frequent household registrations should be conducted to help monitor the trends and impact of health insurance campaigns. Training \textendash{} upstream and downstream \textendash{} on community household registration and data processing should be conducted to arrive at better quality data.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The progress of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) shows that sustained global action can achieve success. Despite the unprecedented achievements in health and education, more than one billion people, many of them in conflict-affected areas, were unable to reap the benefits of the MDG gains. The recently developed Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are even more ambitious then their predecessor. SDG 3 prioritizes health and well-being for all ages in specific areas such as maternal mortality, communicable diseases, mental health, and healthcare workforce. However, without a shift in the approach used for conflict-affected areas, the world's most vulnerable people risk being left behind in global development yet again. We must engage in meaningful discussions about employing innovative strategies to address health challenges fragile, low-resource, and often remote settings. In this paper, we will argue that to meet the ambitious health goals of SDG 3, digital health can help to bridge healthcare gaps in conflict-affected areas. Methods: First, we describe the health needs of populations in conflict-affected environments, and how they overlap with the SDG 3 targets. Secondly, we discuss how digital health can address the unique needs of conflictaffected areas. Finally, we evaluate the various challenges in deploying digital technologies in fragile environments, and discuss potential policy solutions. Discussion: Persons in conflict-affected areas may benefit from the diffusive nature of digital health tools. Innovations using cellular technology or cloud-based solutions overcome physical barriers. Additionally, many of the targets of SDG 3 could see significant progress if efficacious education and outreach efforts were supported, and digital health in the form of mHealth and telehealth offers a relatively low-resource platform for these initiatives. Lastly, lack of data collection, especially in conflict-affected or otherwise fragile states, was one of the primary limitations of the MDGs. Greater investment in data collection efforts, supported by digital health technologies, is necessary if SDG 3 targets are to be measured and progress assessed. Standardized EMR systems as well as context-specific data warehousing efforts will assist in collecting and managing accurate data. Stakeholders such as patients, providers, and NGOs, must be proactive and collaborative in their efforts for continuous progress toward SDG 3. Digital health can assist in these inter-organizational communication efforts. Conclusion: The SDGS are complex, ambitious, and comprehensive; even in the most stable environments, achieving full completion towards every goal will be difficult, and in conflict-affected environments, this challenge is much greater. By engaging in a collaborative framework and using the appropriate digital health tools, we can support humanitarian efforts to realize sustained progress in SDG 3 outcomes.},

  abstract = {Background Information technology has shifted paper-based documentation in the health care sector into a digital form, in which patient information is transferred electronically from one place to another. However, there remain challenges and issues to resolve in this domain owing to the lack of proper standards, the growth of new technologies (mobile devices, tablets, ubiquitous computing), and health care providers who are reluctant to share patient information. Therefore, a solid systematic literature review was performed to understand the use of this new technology in the health care sector. To the best of our knowledge, there is a lack of comprehensive systematic literature reviews that focus on Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR)-based electronic health records (EHRs). In addition, FHIR is the latest standard, which is in an infancy stage of development. Therefore, this is a hot research topic with great potential for further research in this domain. Objective The main aim of this study was to explore and perform a systematic review of the literature related to FHIR, including the challenges, implementation, opportunities, and future FHIR applications. Methods In January 2020, we searched articles published from January 2012 to December 2019 via all major digital databases in the field of computer science and health care, including ACM, IEEE Explorer, Springer, Google Scholar, PubMed, and ScienceDirect. We identified 8181 scientific articles published in this field, 80 of which met our inclusion criteria for further consideration. Results The selected 80 scientific articles were reviewed systematically, and we identified open questions, challenges, implementation models, used resources, beneficiary applications, data migration approaches, and goals of FHIR. Conclusions The literature analysis performed in this systematic review highlights the important role of FHIR in the health care domain in the near future.},

  abstract = {Introduction Low/middle-income countries (LMICs) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are increasingly turning to public contributory health insurance as a mechanism for removing financial barriers to access and extending financial risk protection to the population. Against this backdrop, we assessed the level and inequality of population coverage of existing health insurance schemes in 36 SSA countries. Methods Using secondary data from the most recent Demographic and Health Surveys, we computed mean population coverage for any type of health insurance, and for specific forms of health insurance schemes, by country. We developed concentration curves, computed concentration indices, and rich\textendash poor differences and ratios to examine inequality in health insurance coverage. We decomposed the concentration index using a generalised linear model to examine the contribution of household and individual-level factors to the inequality in health insurance coverage. Results Only four countries had coverage levels with any type of health insurance of above 20\% (Rwanda\textemdash 78.7\% (95\% CI 77.5\% to 79.9\%), Ghana\textemdash 58.2\% (95\% CI 56.2\% to 60.1\%), Gabon\textemdash 40.8\% (95\% CI 38.2\% to 43.5\%), and Burundi 22.0\% (95\% CI 20.7\% to 23.2\%)). Overall, health insurance coverage was low (7.9\% (95\% CI 7.8\% to 7.9\%)) and pro-rich; concentration index=0.4 (95\% CI 0.3 to 0.4, p{$<$}0.001). Exposure to media made the greatest contribution to the pro-rich distribution of health insurance coverage (50.3\%), followed by socioeconomic status (44.3\%) and the level of education (41.6\%). Conclusion Coverage of health insurance in SSA is low and pro-rich. The four countries that had health insurance coverage levels greater than 20\% were all characterised by substantial funding from tax revenues. The other study countries featured predominantly voluntary mechanisms. In a context of high informality of labour markets, SSA and other LMICs should rethink the role of voluntary contributory health insurance and instead embrace tax funding as a sustainable and feasible mechanism for mobilising resources for the health sector.},

This has inevitably stimulated efforts to create a wide-area infrastructure that goes beyond simple store-and-forward to create a platform that makes more general and varied use of the potential of this collection of increasingly powerful nodes. Historically, these efforts predate the advent of globally routed packet networking. The desire for a converged infrastructure of this kind has only intensified over the last 30~years, as memory, storage, and processing resources have increased in both density and speed while simultaneously decreasing in cost. Although there is a general consensus that it should be possible to define and deploy such a dramatically more capable wide-area platform, a great deal of investment in research prototypes has yet to produce a credible candidate architecture. Drawing on technical analysis, historical examples, and case studies, we present an argument for the hypothesis that in order to realize a distributed system with the kind of convergent generality and deployment scalability that might qualify as ``future-defining,'' we must build it from a small set of simple, generic, and limited abstractions of the low level resources (processing, storage and network) of its intermediate nodes.},

  abstract = {The success of machine learning algorithms generally depends on data representation, and we hypothesize that this is because different representations can entangle and hide more or less the different explanatory factors of variation behind the data. Although specific domain knowledge can be used to help design representations, learning with generic priors can also be used, and the quest for AI is motivating the design of more powerful representation-learning algorithms implementing such priors. This paper reviews recent work in the area of unsupervised feature learning and deep learning, covering advances in probabilistic models, autoencoders, manifold learning, and deep networks. This motivates longer term unanswered questions about the appropriate objectives for learning good representations, for computing representations (i.e., inference), and the geometrical connections between representation learning, density estimation, and manifold learning.},

Existing business model literature covers individually owned, multilateral data marketplaces. However, these particular types of data marketplaces hardly reach commercial exploitation. This paper develops business model archetypes for the full array of data marketplace types, ranging from private to independent ownership and from a hierarchical to a market orientation. Through exploratory interviews and case analyses, we create a business model taxonomy. Patterns in our taxonomy reveal four business model archetypes. We find that privately-owned data marketplaces with hierarchical orientation apply the aggregating data marketplace archetype. Consortium-owned data marketplaces apply the archetypes of aggregating data marketplace with additional brokering service and consulting data marketplace. Independently owned data marketplaces with market orientation apply the facilitating data marketplace archetype. Our results provide a basis for configurational theory that explains the performance of data marketplace business models. Our results also provide a basis for specifying boundary conditions for theory on data marketplace business models, as, for instance, the importance of network effects differs strongly between the archetypes.},

However, institutions choose different EHR vendors, and the same product may be implemented differently at different sites. Our goal was to quantify the interoperability of real-world EHR implementations with respect to clinically relevant structured data.We analyzed de-identified and aggregated data from 68 oncology sites that implemented 1 of 5 EHR vendor products. Using 6 medications and 6 laboratory tests for which well-accepted standards exist, we calculated inter- and intra-EHR vendor interoperability scores.The mean intra-EHR vendor interoperability score was 0.68 as compared to a mean of 0.22 for inter-system interoperability, when weighted by number of systems of each type, and 0.57 and 0.20 when not weighting by number of systems of each type.In contrast to data elements required for successful billing, clinically relevant data elements are rarely standardized, even though applicable standards exist. We chose a representative sample of laboratory tests and medications for oncology practices, but our set of data elements should be seen as an example, rather than a definitive list.We defined and demonstrated a quantitative measure of interoperability between site EHR systems and within/between implemented vendor systems. Two sites that share the same vendor are, on average, more interoperable. However, even for implementation of the same EHR product, interoperability is not guaranteed. Our results can inform institutional EHR selection, analysis, and optimization for interoperability.},

While previous research on digital transformation mainly focused on digital transformation within organizations, it is of growing importance to understand the implications for digital transformation on different layers (e.g., interorganizational cooperation and platform ecosystems). In particular, the conceptualization and implications of public data spaces and related ecosystems provide promising research opportunities.

Advanced analytics could power the data collected from numerous sources, both from healthcare institutions, or generated by individuals themselves via apps and devices, and lead to innovations in treatment and diagnosis of diseases; improve the care given to the patient; and empower citizens to participate in the decision-making process regarding their own health and well-being. However, the sensitive nature of the health data prohibits healthcare organizations from sharing the data. The Personal Health Train (PHT) is a novel approach, aiming to establish a distributed data analytics infrastructure enabling the (re)use of distributed healthcare data, while data owners stay in control of their own data. The main principle of the PHT is that data remain in their original location, and analytical tasks visit data sources and execute the tasks. The PHT provides a distributed, flexible approach to use data in a network of participants, incorporating the FAIR principles. It facilitates the responsible use of sensitive and/or personal data by adopting international principles and regulations. This paper presents the concepts and main components of the PHT and demonstrates how it complies with FAIR principles.},

Awareness of the potential value of such infrastructure has been heightened by COVID-19, as the lack of a real-time, interoperable data network impaired disease identification, mitigation, and eradication. The Sepsis on FHIR collaboration establishes a dynamic, federated, and interoperable system of sepsis data from 55 hospitals using 2 distinct inpatient electronic health record systems. Here we report on phase 1, a systematic review to identify clinical variables required to define sepsis and its subtypes to produce a concept mapping of elements onto Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR). Relevant papers described consensus sepsis definitions, provided criteria for sepsis, severe sepsis, septic shock, or detailed sepsis subtypes. Studies not written in English, published prior to 1970, or ``grey'' literature were prospectively excluded. We analyzed 55 manuscripts yielding 151 unique clinical variables. We then mapped variables to their corresponding US Core FHIR resources and specific code values. This work establishes the framework to develop a flexible infrastructure for sharing sepsis data, highlighting how FHIR could enable the extension of this approach to other important conditions relevant to public health.},

The objective of this study was to determine the causes and maternal mortality trends in public hospitals of Tanzania from 2006\textendash 2015. Methods and findings This retrospective study was conducted between July and December 2016 and involved 34 public hospitals in Tanzania. Information on causes of deaths due to pregnancy and delivery complications among women of child-bearing age (15\textendash 49 years old) recorded for the period of 2006\textendash 2015 was extracted. Data sources included inpatient and death registers and International Classification of Disease (ICD)-10 report forms. Maternal deaths were classified based on case definition by ICD 10 and categorized as direct and indirect causes. A total of 40,052 deaths of women of child-bearing age were recorded. There were 1,987 maternal deaths representing 5{$\cdot$}0\% of deaths of all women aged 15\textendash 49 years. The median age-at-death was 27 years (interquartile range: 22, 33). The average age-at-death increased from 25 years in 2006 to 29 years in 2015. Two thirds (67.1\%) of the deaths affected women aged 20\textendash 34 years old. The number of deaths associated with teenage pregnancy (15\textendash 19 years) declined significantly (p-value{$<$}0{$\cdot$}001) from 17.8\% in 2006\textendash 2010 to 11.1\% in 2011\textendash 2015. The proportion of deaths among 30\textendash 34 and 35\textendash 39 years old (all together) increased from 13\% in 2006\textendash 2010 to 15{$\cdot$}3\% in 2011\textendash 2015 (p-value = 0.081). Hospital-based maternal mortality ratio increased from 40.24 (2006) to 57.94/100000 births in 2015. Of the 1,987 deaths, 83.8\% were due to direct causes and 16.2\% were due to indirect causes. Major direct causes were eclampsia (34.0\%), obstetric haemorrhage (24.6\%) and maternal sepsis (16.7\%). Anaemia (14.9\%) and cardiovascular disorders (14.0\%) were the main indirect causes. Causes of maternal deaths were highly related; being attributed to up to three direct causes (0.12\%). Cardiovascular disorders and anaemia had strong linkage with haemorrhage. While there was a decline in the number of deaths due to eclampsia and abortion, those due to haemorrhage and cardiovascular disoders increased during the period. Conclusions During the ten year period (2006\textendash 2015) there was an increase in the number of hospital maternal deaths in public hospitals in Tanzania. Maternal deaths accounted for 5\% of all women of child-bearing age in-hospital mortalities. Most maternal deaths were due to direct causes including eclampsia, haemorrhage and sepsis. The findings of this study provide evidence for better planning and policy formulation for reproductive health programmes to reduce maternal deaths in Tanzania.},

  abstract = {`Design with the user' is a guiding principle for creating digital solutions to solve systemic developmental challenges. According to this principle, digital solutions are more likely to be effective if the intended users are involved in the design process, thereby rooting design thinking in a human-centric approach that seeks to understand their characteristics, needs and challenges. However, few examples exist for human-centred design (HCD) processes being successfully applied in low-and-middle-income countries to create digital health interventions that achieve both scale and sustainability. This paper describes the application of a five-stage HCD process to develop a suite of mobile solutions to improve reproductive, maternal, neonatal and child health in Bihar, India, and discusses lessons learnt. Two of the solutions were later adopted by the government and scaled to 10 million subscribers and more than 300 000 front-line health workers (FLHWs) in 13 states. The socio-ecological model, which considers the interplay between individual, interpersonal, organisational, community and public policy factors, provides a conceptual framework for understanding key learnings from the HCD process. At the organisational level, we found that demand generation was constrained by deficiencies in the public health system, while at the community level, gender norms were a barrier to changing health practices. At the interpersonal level, mobile health solutions for mothers also had to address fathers, because they controlled women's access to mobile phones. At the individual level, FLHWs had limited time to build their skills and needed more flexible, home-based learning opportunities; most FLHWs had access to mobile phones, but devices were overwhelmingly basic and digital skills limited; voice technology was required to maximise reach among low literate women and an authoritative yet empathetic narrator was required to humanise the digital experience, lend credibility and create engagement.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Interoperability is a challenge in healthcare information systems because of heterogeneity in semantic and technical levels of data. It creates a problem in exchanging data from different sources. Person-Generated Health Data (PGHD) is health-related data created, recorded, or collected by individuals or family members, or caregivers. PGHD can be captured passively and continuously to create a more accurate and comprehensive picture of the individual. PGHD is a category of Personal Health Records (PHR) that helps people to store and manage their health records. The rapid growth of PHRs and standards to exchange PHRs in a secure way have improved different aspects of health practices and personal care. OBJECTIVE This is a two-fold study. First, this study aims to investigate Health Level 7's (HL7) new standard, Fast Healthcare Interoperable Resources (FHIR), as a standard format to explain information model (personal, physiological, and behavioral data from heterogeneous sources, such as activity sensor, questionnaire, and interview) and clinical terminologies together. Second, we explore the protocol's advantages in some detail and critically analyze endpoint security of the HL7 application programming interface (HAPI). METHODS To address the interoperability problem, we combine FHIR and internationally acclaimed medical terminologies and use JavaScript object notion (JSON) to represent and exchange PGHD. We develop a secure digital infrastructure with TSD (services for sensitive data) as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), where we deploy the HAPI FHIR server as a docker image. We integrate the concepts such as authentication, authorization, and identity brokering to protect HAPI REST interfaces. PGHD inside TSD are protected following the Norwegian Data Protection Policies (NORMEN) and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We use personal, physiological, and behavioral data involved in health monitoring and store them in the TSD database using the HAPI FHIR server. Storage and retrieval of PGHD from TSD are HL7 compliant. RESULTS First, we discuss storing PGHD in TSD and retrieving it from TSD following HL7 protocol using the HAPI FHIR server in JSON format, combining the information model and medical terminologies. Second, it describes how to secure HAPI REST APIs with the TSD platform. CONCLUSIONS FHIR resources can establish a coherent view of PGHD collected from heterogeneous sources by enabling flexible data exchange between stakeholders and service providers. Besides, the study reveals that TSD is a secure platform for the management of PGHD. CLINICALTRIAL NA},

  abstract = {Big data and machine learning applications focus on retrieving data on a central location for analysis. However, healthcare data can be sensitive in nature and as such difficult to share and make use for secondary purposes. Healthcare vendors are restricted to share data without proper consent from the patient. There is a rising awareness among individual patients as well regarding sharing their personal information due to ethical, legal and societal problems. The current data-sharing platforms in healthcare do not sufficiently handle these issues. The rationale of the Personal Health Train (PHT) approach shifts the focus from sharing data to sharing processing/analysis applications and their respective results. A prerequisite of the PHT-infrastructure is that the data is FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable). The aim of the paper is to describe a methodology of finding the number of patients diagnosed with hypertension and calculate cohort statistics in a privacy-preserving federated manner. The whole process completes without individual patient data leaving the source. For this, we rely on the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard.},

A multivariable regression model was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (AOR) with 95\% confidence intervals for maternal and fetal factors associated with stillbirth. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results The frequency of stillbirth was 3.5\%. Pre-eclampsia (AOR 3.99; 95\% CI: 3.31\textendash 4.81) and placental abruption (AOR 22.62; 95\% CI: 15.41\textendash 33.19) were the strongest maternal risk factors associated with still birth. While non-cephalic presentation (AOR 6.05; 95\% CI: 4.77\textendash 7.66) and low birth weight (AOR 9.66; 95\%CI: 8.66\textendash 10.77) were the fetal factors with the greatest impact on stillbirth. Conclusion The rate of stillbirth in our study was consistent with past studies of developing countries. Numerous maternal and fetal factors risk factors were identified. Early identification of at risk pregnancies and appropriate intervention may help to reduce the occurrence of stillbirth.},

This fragmentation has stifled the creation of a benchmark to directly compare the performance of ReBAC systems based on their common supported policies. To solve this problem, we propose RACON, a schema-driven, customisable ReBAC policy generator. RACON generates policies in an intermediate language subsuming the features required to encode existing ReBAC models. This language can subsequently be translated to popular ReBAC policy languages through an extensible translation module. Taking a view of ReBAC policies as graph queries, we implement translations into two popular graph query languages, namely Cypher and SPARQL.},

  abstract = {Using electronic health (eHealth) platforms is an approach for reaching more people to get services-for example during pandemics or disasters. eHealth platforms help reduce costs and improve the general quality of healthcare. However, establishing eHealth platforms at the national level is challenging due to legal, privacy, and financial constraints. Furthermore, studies on the national eHealth platform in the public sector are scarce. This motivated us to study and understand the process of implementing a public national eHealth platform. We use a qualitative case study as a research approach and the theory of practice and concept of site as lenses to examine the platformization practices of three national-level eHealth platforms. We contribute to the literature by identifying key features of site-shifting in eHealth and describing the practices and features of involved practitioners and the site regarding the process of establishing the platform. Our findings benefit practitioners, as the platformization phases can be seen as lessons when establishing a national eHealth platform. Additionally, the three approaches discussed in this study could be seen as a guide to creating national eHealth platforms.},

The purpose of District Health Information Systems (DHIS) is to document data that are routinely collected in all public health facilities in a country using the system.Objective:The aim of this study was to examine the strengths and operational challenges of DHIS2, with a goal to enable decision makers in different counties to more accurately evaluate the outcomes of introducing DHIS2 into their particular country.Method:A review of the literature combined with the method of meta-synthesis was used to source information and interpret results relating to the strengths and operational challenges of DHIS2. Databases (Embase, PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar) were searched for documents related to strengths and operational challenges of DHIS2, with no time limit up to 8 April 2017. The review and evaluation of selected studies was conducted in three stages: title, abstract and full text. Each of the selected studies was reviewed carefully and key concepts extracted. These key concepts were divided into two categories of strengths and operational challenges of DHIS2. Then, each category was grouped based on conceptual similarity to achieve the main themes and sub-themes. Content analysis was used to analyse extracted data.Results:Of 766 identified citations, 20 studies from 11 countries were included and analysed in this study. Identified strengths in the DHIS were represented in seven themes (with 21 categories): technical features of software, proper management of data, application flexibility, networking and increasing the satisfaction of stakeholders, development of data management, increasing access to information and economic benefits. Operational challenges were identified and captured in 11 themes (with 18 categories): funds; appropriate communication infrastructure; the need for the existence of appropriate data; political, cultural, social and structural infrastructure; manpower; senior managers; training; using academic potentials; definition and standardising the deployment processes; neglect to application of criteria and clinical guidelines in the use of system; data security; stakeholder communications challenges and the necessity to establish a pilot system.Conclusion:This study highlighted specific strengths in the technical and functional aspects of DHIS2 and also drew attention to particular challenges and concerns. These results provide a sound evidence base for decision makers and policymakers to enable them to make more accurate decisions about whether or not to use the DHIS2 in the health system of their country.},

Therefore, this paper develops a research agenda on the openness of data platforms. We explore how data platforms differ from conventional digital platforms (e.g., software platforms). From those differentiating characteristics, we identify areas for future work: (1) The specific characteristics of data require reconceptualizing the object of platform openness; (2) New ways in which data platforms can be opened should be conceptualized; (3) As data platforms are tailored to specific industries, platform-to-platform openness should be a novel unit of analysis; (4) Because opening up data platforms create novel risks, new reasons to (not) open up data platforms should be studied.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Although effects of alternative payment models on health outcomes and health spending are unclear, they are increasingly implemented in maternity care. We aimed to provide an overview of alternative payment models implemented in maternity care, describing their key design elements among which the type of APM, the care providers that participate in the model, populations and care services that are included and the applied risk mitigation strategies. Next to that, we made an inventory of the empirical evidence on the effects of APMs on maternal and neonatal health outcomes and spending on maternity care. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase and Scopus databases for articles published from January 2007 through October 2020. Search key words included `alternative payment model', `value based payment model', `obstetric', `maternity'. English or Dutch language articles were included if they described or empirically evaluated initiatives implementing alternative payment models in maternity care in high-income countries. Additional relevant documents were identified through reference tracking. We systematically analyzed the initiatives found and examined the evidence regarding health outcomes and health spending. The process was guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) to ensure validity and reliability. Results: We identified 17 initiatives that implemented alternative payment models in maternity care. Thirteen in the United States, two in the United Kingdom, one in New Zealand and one in the Netherlands. Within these initiatives three types of alternative payment models were implemented; pay-for-performance (n = 2), shared savings models (n = 7) and bundled payment models (n = 8). Alternative payment models that shifted more financial accountability towards providers seemed to include more strategies that mitigated those risks. Risk mitigation strategies were applied to the included population, included services or at the level of total expenditures. Of these seventeen initiatives, we found four empirical effect studies published in peer-reviewed journals. Three of them were of moderate quality and one weak. Two studies described an association of the alternative payment model with an improvement of specific health outcomes and two studies described a reduction in medical spending. Conclusions: This study shows that key design elements of alternative payment models including risk mitigation strategies vary highly. Risk mitigation strategies seem to be relevant tools to increase APM uptake and protect providers from (initially) bearing too much (perceived) financial risk. Empirical evidence on the effects of APMs on health outcomes and spending is still limited. A clear definition of key design elements and a further, in-depth, understanding of key design elements and how they operate into different health settings is required to shape payment reform that aligns with its goals.},

  abstract = {Introduction:To address high levels of maternal mortality in Kigoma, Tanzania, stakeholders increased women's access to high-quality comprehensive emergency obstetric and newborn care (EmONC) by decentralizing services from hospitals to health centers where EmONC was delivered mostly by associate clinicians and nurses. To ensure that women used services, implementers worked to continuously improve and sustain quality of care while creating demand. Methods:Program evaluation included periodic health facility assessments, pregnancy outcome monitoring, and enhanced maternal mortality detection region-wide in program- and nonprogram-supported health facilities. Results:Between 2013 and 2018, the average number of lifesaving interventions performed per facility increased from 2.8 to 4.7. The increase was higher in program-supported than nonprogram-supported health centers and dispensaries. The institutional delivery rate increased from 49\% to 85\%; the greatest increase occurred through using health centers (15\% to 25\%) and dispensaries (21\% to 46\%). The number of cesarean deliveries almost doubled, and the population cesarean delivery rate increased from 2.6\% to 4.5\%. Met need for emergency obstetric care increased from 44\% to 61\% while the direct obstetric case fatality rate declined from 1.8\% to 1.4\%. The institutional maternal mortality ratio across all health facilities declined from 303 to 174 deaths per 100,000 live births. The total stillbirth rate declined from 26.7 to 12.8 per 1,000 births. The predischarge neonatal mortality rate declined from 10.7 to 7.6 per 1,000 live births. Changes in case fatality rate and maternal mortality were driven by project-supported facilities. Changes in neonatal mortality varied depending on facility type and program support status. Conclusion:Decentralizing high-quality comprehensive EmONC delivered mostly by associate clinicians and nurses led to significant improvements in the availability and utilization of lifesaving care at birth in Kigoma. Dedicated efforts to sustain high-quality EmONC along with supplemental programmatic components contributed to the reduction of maternal and perinatal mortality.},

We conducted a scoping review to identify trends and gaps in the use of FHIR for clinical research.We reviewed published literature, federally funded project databases, application websites, and other sources to discover FHIR-based papers, projects, and tools (collectively, ``FHIR projects'') available to support clinical research activities.Our search identified 203 different FHIR projects applicable to clinical research. Most were associated with preparations to conduct research, such as data mapping to and from FHIR formats (n\,=\,66, 32.5\%) and managing ontologies with FHIR (n\,=\,30, 14.8\%), or post-study data activities, such as sharing data using repositories or registries (n\,=\,24, 11.8\%), general research data sharing (n\,=\,23, 11.3\%), and management of genomic data (n\,=\,21, 10.3\%). With the exception of phenotyping (n\,=\,19, 9.4\%), fewer FHIR-based projects focused on needs within the clinical research process itself.Funding and usage of FHIR-enabled solutions for research are expanding, but most projects appear focused on establishing data pipelines and linking clinical systems such as electronic health records, patient-facing data systems, and registries, possibly due to the relative newness of FHIR and the incentives for FHIR integration in health information systems. Fewer FHIR projects were associated with research-only activities.The FHIR standard is becoming an essential component of the clinical research enterprise. To develop FHIR's full potential for clinical research, funding and operational stakeholders should address gaps in FHIR-based research tools and methods.},

  abstract = {Background: Electronic medical records have transformed the collection, storage, retrieval and use of medical information. This led to hospitals increasing investments in EMR adoption and implementation in both developed and developing countries. However, the EMR implementation is complex thus calls for the necessity of assessing the successes of such investments at the various stages of implementation. Therefore, this study aimed at assessing the adoption and users experience of the Government of Tanzania-Hospital Management Information System (GoT-HoMIS) in a primary healthcare facility.Methodology: A case study employing qualitative approach was conducted in Meru district hospital between May and June 2019. In-depth interviews, observations and documents review were used. We interviewed nine key informants including two hospital managers, one information technology officer, two clinicians, one laboratory technologist, one pharmacist, one medical recorder and one nurse assistant. Thematic analysis of qualitative data was used.Results: The study found that the top-down approach used in adoption of GoT-HoMIS limited the preliminary preparations made by the hospital. Availability of local area network, reliable electrical power supply and perceived benefits facilitated the system use. The system use was hindered by a partial system implementation, inadequate ICT infrastructure, low level of ICT knowledge and skills among users, and inadequate management support.Conclusion: This study identified a partial implementation and use of the system in the hospital, inadequate ICT knowledge and skills among users, and insufficient management support in provision of funds for ICT infrastructure, trainings, supervision and mentorship as the main barriers to effectively use the GoT-HoMIS. Therefore, the study recommends enhancement of ICT infrastructure, regular trainings to users and strengthening leadership, and management support of system implementation.Funding Information: The authors have not received any funding from any organization for this study.Declaration of Interests: The authors declare no conflict of interest.Ethics Approval Statement: A written ethical clearance was obtained from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences, Tanzania. The permission to conduct the study was obtained from the Meru District Medical Officer (DMO) and hospital medical officer in-charge. During data collection process, the written voluntary consent was obtained from each participant prior to participation. Participants' anonymity was ensured, their information was considered confidential to be used for the purpose of this study only.

  abstract = {We apply multiparty computation (MPC) techniques to show, given a database that is secret-shared among multiple mutually distrustful parties, how the parties may obliviously construct a decision tree based on the secret data. We consider data with continuous attributes (i.e., coming from a large domain), and develop a secure version of a learning algorithm similar to the C4.5 or CART algorithms. Previous MPC-based work only focused on decision tree learning with discrete attributes (De Hoogh et al. 2014). Our starting point is to apply an existing generic MPC protocol to a standard decision tree learning algorithm, which we then optimize in several ways. We exploit the fact that even if we allow the data to have continuous values, which a priori might require fixed or floating point representations, the output of the tree learning algorithm only depends on the relative ordering of the data. By obliviously sorting the data we reduce the number of comparisons needed per node to \$O(N \textbackslash log{\^2} N)\$ from the naive \$O(N{\^2})\$, where \$N\$ is the number of training records in the dataset, thus making the algorithm feasible for larger datasets. This does however introduce a problem when duplicate values occur in the dataset, but we manage to overcome this problem with a relatively cheap subprotocol. We show a procedure to convert a sorting network into a permutation network of smaller complexity, resulting in a round complexity of \$O(\textbackslash log N)\$ per layer in the tree. We implement our algorithm in the MP-SPDZ framework and benchmark our implementation for both passive and active three-party computation using arithmetic modulo \$2\^\{64\}\$. We apply our implementation to a large scale medical dataset of \$\textbackslash approx 290\textbackslash,000\$ rows using random forests, and thus demonstrate practical feasibility of using MPC for privacy-preserving machine learning based on decision trees for large datasets.Fixed acknowledgements},

Here, we focused on the implementation of the Safer Deliveries CHW programme in Zanzibar, a programme designed to address high rates of maternal and neonatal mortality by increasing rates of health facility delivery and postnatal care visits. The programme was implemented and brought to scale in 10 of 11 districts in Zanzibar over the course of 3 years by D-tree International and the Zanzibar Ministry of Health. As the programme utilized a mobile app to support CHWs during their visits, a rich data resource comprised of 133~481 pregnancy and postpartum home visits from 41~653 women and 436 CHWs was collected, enabling the evaluation of numerous measures related to intervention fidelity and health outcomes. Utilizing the framework of Steckler et al., we completed a formal process evaluation of the primary intervention, CHW home visits to women during their pregnancy and postpartum period. Our in-depth analysis and discussion will serve as a model for process evaluations of similar CHW programmes and will hopefully encourage future implementers to report analogous measures of programme performance.},

Databases' performance and suitability to health care tasks are dramatically affected by how their data storage model and query capabilities are well-adapted to the use case scenario. On the other hand, standardized healthcare data modeling is one of the most favorable paths for achieving semantic interoperability, facilitating patient data integration from different healthcare systems. This paper compares the state-of-the-art of the most crucial database management systems used for storing standardized EHRs data. It discusses different database models' appropriateness for meeting different EHRs functions with different database specifications and workload scenarios. Insights into relevant literature show how flexible NoSQL databases (document, column, and graph) effectively deal with standardized EHRs data's distinctive features, especially in the distributed healthcare system, leading to better EHR.},

In relation to Ostrom's DPs, the CPRs under review involve management only by the community, co-management between the community and the state, and co-management between the community and non-governmental organizations. The results show that: DPs have been applied in all the inhabited continents; the expression of the DPs is affected by the geographical settings; the DPs do not conclusively diagnose the functionality of young and viable CPR institutions, whereas they may do so for either the short-lived (failed) or the long-lasting institutions; the relationship between robustness and success appears weak; and there are additional factors that contribute to the outcomes of CPR management.},

However, one of the main obstacles to why actors are currently not motivated to engage in data ecosystems is that they are often not aware of the actual benefits of cross-organisational data sharing. This is partly because it is in many cases unclear what the incentives and ultimately the added value are for data providers when they share their data with others. To address this research gap we develop a taxonomy of incentive mechanisms for data sharing in data ecosystems which is based on a structured literature review. The resulting taxonomy consists of key dimensions and characteristics of incentive mechanisms for data sharing in data ecosystems and contributes to a better scientific understanding of these concepts.},

Further, skilled birth attendance and the use of antenatal care are most inequitably distributed in maternal and newborn health interventions in low- and middle-income countries. Conditional cash transfer (CCT) programmes have been shown to increase health service utilization among the poorest but little is written on the effects of such programmes on maternal and newborn health. We carried out a systematic review of studies on CCT that report maternal and newborn health outcomes, including studies from 8 countries. The CCT programmes have increased antenatal visits, skilled attendance at birth, delivery at a health facility, and tetanus toxoid vaccination for mothers and reduced the incidence of low birthweight. The programmes have not had a significant impact on fertility while the impact on maternal and newborn mortality has not been well-documented thus far. Given these positive effects, we make the case for further investment in CCT programmes for maternal and newborn health, noting gaps in knowledge and providing recommendations for better design and evaluation of such programmes. We recommend more rigorous impact evaluations that document impact pathways and take factors, such as cost-effectiveness, into account.},

Members determine which data they want to share for example with doctors or to contribute to research for the benefit of their health and that of society.

However, while `formal' (top-down) mhealth programmes continue to face challenges of scalability and sustainability, we know relatively little about how health-workers are using their own mobile phones informally in their work. Using data from Ghana, Ethiopia and Malawi, we document the reach, nature and perceived impacts of community health-workers' (CHWs') `informal mhealth' practices, and ask how equitably these are distributed. We implemented a mixed-methods study, combining surveys of CHWs across the three countries, using multi-stage proportional-to-size sampling (N~=~2197 total), with qualitative research (interviews and focus groups with CHWs, clients and higher-level stake-holders). Survey data were weighted to produce nationally- or regionally-representative samples for multivariate analysis; comparative thematic analysis was used for qualitative data. Our findings confirm the limited reach of `formal' compared with `informal' mhealth: while only 15\% of CHWs surveyed were using formal mhealth applications, over 97\% reported regularly using a personal mobile phone for work-related purposes in a range of innovative ways. CHWs and clients expressed unequivocally enthusiastic views about the perceived impacts of this `informal health' usage. However, they also identified very real practical challenges, financial burdens and other threats to personal wellbeing; these appear to be borne disproportionately by the lowest-paid cadre of health-workers, especially those serving rural areas. Unlike previous small-scale, qualitative studies, our work has shown that informal mhealth is already happening at scale, far outstripping its formal equivalent. Policy-makers need to engage seriously with this emergent health system, and to work closely with those on the ground to address sources of inequity, without undermining existing good practice.},

  abstract = {Electronic Health Records (EHR) presents opportunities to improve interoperability between healthcare services. Interoperability is needed by the primary health centers in Indonesia to enable seamless transfer of patient's health records across healthcare facilities. However, the development of EHR in Indonesia makes interoperability difficult to achieve because it is built differently among healthcare services. This study aims to explore the feasibility of implementing the HL7 FHIR standard in the Indonesian primary health center's EHR. Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is a health interoperability standard developed by HL7 that supports syntactic interoperability upon the concept of resources and API. This interoperability standard helps to build the bridge to enable coordination between different systems. In this study, we implemented an EHR client-server prototype to simulate the exchange of health data using the FHIR resources and REST API. The health data messages were modeled and structured as a FHIR resource. The calculation of content overlap shows that only 65.8\% of local health data can be represented as a FHIR resource. We did the profiling to further adapt the use of FHIR resources to meet Indonesia's health data requirements. The extensions were added to represent the local data elements that FHIR resources cannot cover. This preliminary study showed that FHIR implementation is possible in Indonesia's primary health centers. The implementation of 111.7 FHIR using FHIR resources, profile, and REST API supports the syntactic and semantic interoperability. It can provide quality data to support the referral system, analysis purposes, and health decision-making.},

Leveraging a mobile health platform can be a powerful tool to address these problems. This paper demonstrates how analysing data collected from a mobile health platform helps optimize healthcare provider networks, monitor patient flows and assess the quality and equitability of access to care. The COVID-19 pandemic reinforces the importance of real-time data on health-seeking behaviour. Between 2018 and 2019, as a Kenyan universal health coverage pilot was being planned, Kisumu County, with support from PharmAccess Foundation, implemented household-level digital registration for healthcare and collected socio-economic and healthcare claims data using the M-TIBA platform. In total, 273,350 Kisumu households enrolled. The claims data showed many patients visit higher-level facilities for ailments, that can be treated at primary care levels, unnecessarily. High-level estimate of the disease burden at participating facilities revealed rampant overprescription of pertinent medicines for highly prevalent malaria and respiratory tract infections, exemplifying clinical management deficiencies. M-TIBA data allowed tracking of individual patient trajectories. Analyses of data are shown at the aggregate level. The paper shows how mobile health platforms can be used to generate valuable insights into access to and quality of care. Funding for healthcare can be united through mobile health platforms, limiting the fragmentation in funding. They can be useful for funders, health managers and policymakers to improve the implementation of universal health coverage programs in low-and middle-income countries.},

  abstract = {Background Cash transfers and vouchers are forms of `demand-side financing' that have been widely used to promote maternal and newborn health in low- and middle-income countries during the last 15 years. Methods This systematic review consolidates evidence from seven published systematic reviews on the effects of different types of cash transfers and vouchers on the use and quality of maternity care services, and updates the systematic searches to June 2015 using the Joanna Briggs Institute approach for systematic reviewing. The review protocol for this update was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42015020637). Results Data from 51 studies (15 more than previous reviews) and 22 cash transfer and voucher programmes suggest that approaches tied to service use (either via payment conditionalities or vouchers for selected services) can increase use of antenatal care, use of a skilled attendant at birth and in the case of vouchers, postnatal care too. The strongest evidence of positive effect was for conditional cash transfers and uptake of antenatal care, and for vouchers for maternity care services and birth with a skilled birth attendant. However, effects appear to be shaped by a complex set of social and healthcare system barriers and facilitators. Studies have typically focused on an initial programme period, usually two or three years after initiation, and many lack a counterfactual comparison with supply-side investment. There are few studies to indicate that programmes have led to improvements in quality of maternity care or maternal and newborn health outcomes. Conclusion Future research should use multiple intervention arms to compare cost-effectiveness with similar investment in public services, and should look beyond short- to medium-term service utilisation by examining programme costs, longer-term effects on service utilisation and health outcomes, and the equity of those effects.},

The proposed model is implemented as restful web services and data is stored in a NoSQL database for flexibility. To evaluate effectiveness, the system was reviewed by healthcare providers and expectant women. Their feedback highlights the usefulness of the proposed system as compared to traditional record keeping techniques. It is anticipated that the proposed system will lay the foundation of a comprehensive maternal healthcare information system.

  abstract = {Background There is increasing recognition of the importance of sharing research data within the international scientific community, but also of the ethical and social challenges this presents, particularly in the context of structural inequities and varied capacity in international research. Public involvement is essential to building locally responsive research policies, including on data sharing, but little research has involved stakeholders from low-to-middle income countries. Methods Between January and June 2014, a qualitative study was conducted in Kenya involving sixty stakeholders with varying experiences of research in a deliberative process to explore views on benefits and challenges in research data sharing. In-depth interviews and extended small group discussions based on information sharing and facilitated debate were used to collect data. Data were analysed using Framework Analysis, and charting flow and dynamics in debates. Findings The findings highlight both the opportunities and challenges of communicating about this complex and relatively novel topic for many stakeholders. For more and less research-experienced stakeholders, ethical research data sharing is likely to rest on the development and implementation of appropriate trust-building processes, linked to local perceptions of benefits and challenges. The central nature of trust is underpinned by uncertainties around who might request what data, for what purpose and when. Key benefits perceived in this consultation were concerned with the promotion of public health through science, with legitimate beneficiaries defined differently by different groups. Important challenges were risks to the interests of study participants, communities and originating researchers through stigmatisation, loss of privacy, impacting autonomy and unfair competition, including through forms of intentional and unintentional 'misuse' of data. Risks were also seen for science. Discussion Given background structural inequities in much international research, building trust in this low-to-middle income setting includes ensuring that the interests of study participants, primary communities and originating researchers will be promoted as far as possible, as well as protected. Important ways of building trust in data sharing include involving the public in policy development and implementation, promoting scientific collaborations around data sharing and building close partnerships between researchers and government health authorities to provide checks and balances on data sharing, and promote near and long-term translational benefits.},

For instance, with the emergence of distributed applications, several providers are usually correlating their records, and providing personalized services to their clients. Collected data include geographical and indoor positions of users, their movement patterns as well as sensor-acquired data that may reveal users' physical conditions, habits and interests. Consequently, this may lead to undesired consequences such as unsolicited advertisement and even to discrimination and stalking. To mitigate privacy threats, several techniques emerged, referred to as Privacy Enhancing Technologies, PETs for short. On one hand, the increasing pressure on service providers to protect users' privacy resulted in PETs being adopted. One the other hand, service providers have built their business model on personalized services, e.g. targeted ads and news. The objective of the paper is then to identify which of the PETs have the potential to satisfy both usually divergent - economical and ethical - purposes. This paper identifies a taxonomy classifying eight categories of PETs into three groups, and for better clarity, it considers three categories of personalized services. After defining and presenting the main features of PETs with illustrative examples, the paper points out which PETs best fit each personalized service category. Then, it discusses some of the inter-disciplinary privacy challenges that may slow down the adoption of these techniques, namely: technical, social, legal and economic concerns. Finally, it provides recommendations and highlights several research directions.},

Rapid advances in mobile technology offer the potential to mediate access to essential services. Through this research, the answers to the following question were explored: will mobile service platforms bridge the gap between service providers and people living at the base of the pyramid in developing countries? Anchored in interviews with 31 experts in the field of mobile and ICT, qualitative analysis starting from platform leadership to explain the role of mobile service platforms is presented: how operator, device and service provider centric platforms compete, collaborate and open up (or not) for delivering scalable services to the poor. Based on the analysis in this paper, it is portended that although operator centric platforms are in pole position, device centric platform providers, being astute innovators, are positioned to close the lead by presenting alternatives to bridge the gap in developing countries. This paper frames the current debate on M4D through the lens of platform theory, and aims to provide guidance to policy makers to improve access to services for the poor.},

  abstract = {Background and objective Healthcare systems deal with multiple challenges in releasing information from data silos, finding it almost impossible to be implemented, maintained and upgraded, with difficulties ranging in the technical, security and human interaction fields. Currently, the increasing availability of health data is demanding data-driven approaches, bringing the opportunities to automate healthcare related tasks, providing better disease detection, more accurate prognosis, faster clinical research advance and better fit for patient management. In order to share data with as many stakeholders as possible, interoperability is the only sustainable way for letting systems to talk with one another and getting the complete image of a patient. Thus, it becomes clear that an efficient solution in the data exchange incompatibility is of extreme importance. Consequently, interoperability can develop a communication framework between non-communicable systems, which can be achieved through transforming healthcare data into ontologies. However, the multidimensionality of healthcare domain and the way that is conceptualized, results in the creation of different ontologies with contradicting or overlapping parts. Thus, an effective solution to this problem is the development of methods for finding matches among the various components of ontologies in healthcare, in order to facilitate semantic interoperability. Methods The proposed mechanism promises healthcare interoperability through the transformation of healthcare data into the corresponding HL7 FHIR structure. In more detail, it aims at building ontologies of healthcare data, which are later stored into a triplestore. Afterwards, for each constructed ontology the syntactic and semantic similarities with the various HL7 FHIR Resources ontologies are calculated, based on their Levenshtein distance and their semantic fingerprints accordingly. Henceforth, after the aggregation of these results, the matching to the HL7 FHIR Resources takes place, translating the healthcare data into a widely adopted medical standard. Results Through the derived results it can be seen that there exist cases that an ontology has been matched to a specific HL7 FHIR Resource due to its syntactic similarity, whereas the same ontology has been matched to a different HL7 FHIR Resource due to its semantic similarity. Nevertheless, the developed mechanism performed well since its matching results had exact match with the manual ontology matching results, which are considered as a reference value of high quality and accuracy. Moreover, in order to furtherly investigate the quality of the developed mechanism, it was also evaluated through its comparison with the Alignment API, as well as the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-III) which provide ontology alignment. In both cases, the results of all the different implementations were almost identical, proving the developed mechanism's high efficiency, whereas through the comparison with the NSGA-III algorithm, it was observed that the developed mechanism needs additional improvements, through a potential adoption of the NSGA-III technique. Conclusions The developed mechanism creates new opportunities in conquering the field of healthcare interoperability. However, according to the mechanism's evaluation results, it is almost impossible to create syntactic or semantic patterns for understanding the nature of a healthcare dataset. Hence, additional work should be performed in evaluating the developed mechanism, and updating it with respect to the results that will derive from its comparison with similar ontology matching mechanisms and data of multiple nature.},

  abstract = {Background The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal \#3.8 targets `access to quality essential healthcare services'. Clinical practice guidelines are an important tool for ensuring quality of clinical care, but many challenges prevent their use in low-resource settings. Monitoring the use of guidelines relies on cumbersome clinical audits of paper records, and electronic systems face financial and other limitations. Here we describe a unique approach to generating digital data from paper using guideline-based templates, rubber stamps and mobile phones. Intervention The Guidelines Adherence in Slums Project targeted ten private sector primary healthcare clinics serving informal settlements in Nairobi, Kenya. Each clinic was provided with rubber stamp templates to support documentation and management of commonly encountered outpatient conditions. Participatory design methods were used to customize templates to the workflows and infrastructure of each clinic. Rubber stamps were used to print templates into paper charts, providing clinicians with checklists for use during consultations. Templates used bubble format data entry, which could be digitized from images taken on mobile phones. Besides rubber stamp templates, the intervention included booklets of guideline compilations, one Android phone for digitizing images of templates, and one data feedback/continuing medical education session per clinic each month. In this paper we focus on the effect of the intervention on documentation of three non-communicable diseases in one clinic. Methods Seventy charts of patients enrolled in the chronic disease program (hypertension/diabetes, n=867; chronic respiratory diseases, n=223) at one of the ten intervention clinics were sampled. Documentation of each individual patient encounter in the pre-intervention (January\textendash March 2016) and post-intervention period (May\textendash July) was scored for information in four dimensions \textendash{} general data, patient assessment, testing, and management. Control criteria included information with no counterparts in templates (e.g. notes on presenting complaints, vital signs). Documentation scores for each patient were compared between both pre- and post-intervention periods and between encounters documented with and without templates (post-intervention only). Results The total number of patient encounters in the pre-intervention (282) and post-intervention periods (264) did not differ. Mean documentation scores increased significantly in the post-intervention period on average by 21\%, 24\% and 17\% for hypertension, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases, respectively. Differences were greater (47\%, 43\% and 27\%, respectively) when documentation with and without templates was compared. Changes between pre- vs.post-intervention, and with vs.without template, varied between individual dimensions of documentation. Overall, documentation improved more for general data and patient assessment than in testing or management. Conclusion The use of templates improves paper-based documentation of patient care, a first step towards improving the quality of care. Rubber stamps provide a simple and low-cost method to print templates on demand. In combination with ubiquitously available mobile phones, information entered on paper can be easily and rapidly digitized. This `frugal innovation' in m-Health can empower small, private sector facilities, where large numbers of urban patients seek healthcare, to generate digital data on routine outpatient care. These data can form the basis for evidence-based quality improvement efforts at large scale, and help deliver on the SDG promise of quality essential healthcare services for all.},

The aim is to provide the end-users total self-governance over their own data. While this enables certain degree of user empowerment, the explicit design principles of PDS architecture may prevent service providers' legitimate grounds for imposing certain restrictions on the data rights (e.g., for government regulations). In this paper, we propose a unique hybrid PDS architecture that extends SOLiD with blockchain and smart contract. The extension provides a neutral access control enforcement platform in which service providers can transparently define and operate application-wide data access policies, overriding the default user access rights in some cases, while still respecting the decentralised nature of Personal Data Store. We implemented an instance of the architecture using a university assignment management as a scenario to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework.},

Studying the case of Burkina Faso, we use hand-collected data from individual responses to a survey we designed and conducted between May and June 2014. Our main results show that, although it is not possible to detect any correlation between using mobile money and saving for predictable events, it seems to increase the propensity of individuals to save for health emergencies. We also found robust evidence suggestive that using mobile money increases the propensity of disadvantaged groups such as rural, female, less educated individuals and individuals with irregular income to save for health emergencies. In our further investigations, we address the mechanisms underlying individual saving behaviour. We found that safety and the possibility to transfer money within the sub-region associated with mobile money may be factors that increase the propensity of mobile money users to save for health emergencies. Overall, our results are in line with policymakers' agenda worldwide to increase financial outreach and improve financial inclusion by using mobile technologies.},

Contrary to traditional approaches to health-systems reform that emphasize cost containment, value-based health care shifts the focus to continuous improvement in the outcomes delivered to patients. Systematically measuring, tracking, and improving health outcomes over time can have a transformative effect, enabling health systems to:deliver better patient outcomes and overall population health more consistentlyidentify and disseminate best-practice diagnoses and treatments more rapidlycontrol total health-care costs more effectively because unnecessary procedures are eliminated, expensive complications occur less frequently, and repeat treatments are avoidedrebuild the trust and motivation of health professionals by aligning system performance goals with professional purposeThe only way for the health care sector to sustainably contain costs and fulfill its mission is by putting the patient and the delivery of outcomes that matter to patients at the center of the industry's efforts and by aligning incentives around the continuous improvement of health outcomes in a cost-effective manner.Designed by thought leaders at Boston Consulting Group as a practical step-by-step guide for clinicians, payers, policymakers, and other industry stakeholders, The Patient Priority features powerful case studies of leading value-based innovators \rule{1em}{1pt}both public and private, as well as from both high- and low-income countries\rule{1em}{1pt}that are taking the concept of value-based health care from theory to practice.

In 2007, a community-based health insurance programme was implemented in selected rural communities in Kwara State, Nigeria, through collaboration between the Dutch Health Insurance Fund, PharmAccess Foundation, the Kwara State Government, and Hygeia Nigeria Limited to provide access to basic healthcare for the people. After operating for 9 years, the programme stopped in 2016. This paper describes how social and political accountability shaped the introduction, functioning, and stoppage of the CBHI programme. The study adopted a qualitative approach for data collection, particularly in-depth (n = 22) and key informant interviews (n = 32). Findings indicate that the community-based health insurance programme was proposed by the foreign agency and that the state government was instrumental in the stoppage of the programme. Also, the change in government (via voting against a political bloc that had been in power since 2003) in Kwara State during the 2019 general elections was among the accountability measures employed by the citizenry in reaction to the stoppage of the Community-Based Health Insurance programme. The implication of this is that the current government, expectedly, will not only draw up a more robust healthcare policy for implementation but will also ensure that the people are carried along through adequate social and political accountability mechanisms.},

Design/methodology/approach A survey of over 210 mobile phone consumers was made. The study added two additional constructs \textendash{} perceived regulatory support (PRS) and promotional benefits (PBs) \textendash{} and proposed an integrated approach to understanding mobile wallet adoption. The hypothesized relationships were analysed via structural equation modelling. Findings The results indicated performance expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, perceived risk, perceived value, PRS, as well as PBs, to be significant factors in predicting behavioural intentions to adopt mobile wallet solutions. The impact of effort expectancy was found to be statistically insignificant. Research limitations/implications The small sample size and the possibility of including new variables such as personal innovativeness, which have not been addressed here, are some of the limitations of this study. Practical implications The findings of this paper would be useful for mobile wallet service providers, mobile app writers and institutions involved in the facilitation and regulation of such services to develop suitable strategic frameworks to encourage the adoption of mobile wallets. Originality/value The study is the first of its kind in India and has added a new dimension in the assessment of technology adoption by proposing two new variables.},

  abstract = {Lack of interoperability and integration between heterogeneous health systems is a big challenge to realize the potential benefits of eHealth. To best move from siloed applications to interoperable eHealth solutions, health information exchange (HIE) policy and standards are necessary to be established. However, there is no comprehensive evidence on the current status of HIE policy and standards on the African continent. Therefore, this paper aimed to systematically review the status of HIE policy and standards which are currently in practice in Africa. A systematic search of the literature was conducted from Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), Scopus, Web of Science, and Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), and a total of 32 papers (21 strategic documents and 11 peer-reviewed papers) were selected based on predefined criteria for synthesis. Results revealed that African countries have paid attention to the development, improvement, adoption, and implementation of HIE architecture for interoperability and standards. Synthetic and semantic interoperability standards were identified for the implementation of HIE in Africa. Based on this comprehensive review, we recommend that comprehensive interoperable technical standards should be set at each national level and should be guided by appropriate governance and legal frameworks, data ownership and use agreements, and health data privacy and security guidelines. On top of the policy issues, there is a need to identify a set of standards (health system standards, communication, messaging standards, terminology/vocabulary standards, patient profile standards, privacy and security, and risk assessment) and implement them throughout all levels of the health system. On top of this, we recommend that the Africa Union (AU) and regional bodies provide the necessary human resource and high-level technical support to African countries to implement HIE policy and standards. To realize the full potential of eHealth in the continent, it is recommended that African countries need to have a common HIE policy, interoperable technical standards, and health data privacy and security guidelines. Currently, there is an ongoing effort by the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) towards promoting HIE on the continent. A task force has been established from Africa CDC, Health Information Service Provider (HISP) partners, and African and global HIE subject matter experts to provide expertise and guidance in the development of AU policy and standards for HIE. Although the work is still ongoing, the African Union shall continue to support the implementation of HIE policy and standards in the continent. The authors of this review are currently working under the umbrella of the African Union to develop the HIE policy and standard to be endorsed by the head of states of the Africa Union. As a follow-up publication to this, the result will be published in mid-2022.},

  abstract = {Objective In early 2010, Harvard Medical School and Boston Children's Hospital began an interoperability project with the distinctive goal of developing a platform to enable medical applications to be written once and run unmodified across different healthcare IT systems. The project was called Substitutable Medical Applications and Reusable Technologies (SMART). Methods We adopted contemporary web standards for application programming interface transport, authorization, and user interface, and standard medical terminologies for coded data. In our initial design, we created our own openly licensed clinical data models to enforce consistency and simplicity. During the second half of 2013, we updated SMART to take advantage of the clinical data models and the application-programming interface described in a new, openly licensed Health Level Seven draft standard called Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR). Signaling our adoption of the emerging FHIR standard, we called the new platform SMART on FHIR. Results We introduced the SMART on FHIR platform with a demonstration that included several commercial healthcare IT vendors and app developers showcasing prototypes at the Health Information Management Systems Society conference in February 2014. This established the feasibility of SMART on FHIR, while highlighting the need for commonly accepted pragmatic constraints on the base FHIR specification. Conclusion In this paper, we describe the creation of SMART on FHIR, relate the experience of the vendors and developers who built SMART on FHIR prototypes, and discuss some challenges in going from early industry prototyping to industry-wide production use.},

We aimed to understand whether and how digital health technologies (DHTs) are absorbed in Africa, tracking Ethiopia as a key node. We conducted a systematic review, searching PubMed-MEDLINE, Embase, ScienceDirect, African Journals Online, Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform databases from inception to 02 February 2021 for studies of any design that investigated the potential of DHTs in clinical or public health practices in Ethiopia. This review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021240645) and it was designed to inform our ongoing DHT-enabled randomized controlled trial (RCT) (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT04216420). We found 27,493 potentially relevant citations, among which 52 studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising a total of 596,128 patients, healthy individuals, and healthcare professionals. The studies involved six DHTs: mHealth (29 studies, 574,649 participants); electronic health records (13 studies, 4534 participants); telemedicine (4 studies, 465 participants); cloud-based application (2 studies, 2382 participants); information communication technology (3 studies, 681 participants), and artificial intelligence (1 study, 13,417 participants). The studies targeted six health conditions: maternal and child health (15), infectious diseases (14), non-communicable diseases (3), dermatitis (1), surgery (4), and general health conditions (15). The outcomes of interest were feasibility, usability, willingness or readiness, effectiveness, quality improvement, and knowledge or attitude toward DHTs. Five studies involved RCTs. The analysis showed that although DHTs are a relatively recent phenomenon in Ethiopia, their potential harnessing clinical and public health practices are highly visible. Their adoption and implementation in full capacity require more training, access to better devices such as smartphones, and infrastructure. DHTs hold much promise tackling major clinical and public health backlogs and strengthening the healthcare ecosystem in Ethiopia. More RCTs are needed on emerging DHTs including artificial intelligence, big data, cloud, cybersecurity, telemedicine, and wearable devices to provide robust evidence of their potential use in such settings and to materialize the WHO's Global Strategy on Digital Health.},

  abstract = {Background: Maternal mortality remains a public health concern in low income countries particularly in sub-Saharan Africa where majority (62\%) of maternal deaths occurs. In Tanzania maternal mortality ratio is as high as 432 deaths per 100,000 live births. Objectives: This study aimed to describe pattern of maternal mortality ratio and its associated causes at Shinyanga regional referral hospital. We also assessed the availability of the comprehensive emergency obstetric care services in the study setting. Methods: This was retrospective cross-sectional study which was conducted from April to May 2015 at Shinyanga Regional Referral Hospital. Information on demographic data, obstetric factors associated with maternal death and their causes as well as their management were extracted from the patient's record file between 2010 and 2014 by using data extraction sheet. Data analysis was performed using SPSS version 18.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). Descriptive statistical analysis were summarized. Results: Overall maternal mortality ratio declined from 635/100,000 live births in 2010 to 449/100,000 live births in 2014. The main causes of maternal death were postpartum haemorrhage (50\%) and pre-eclampsia/eclampsia (20\%). Majority (77\%) of the delays were encountered at hospital and at home (56\%). Numerous forms of management were provided to women who experienced maternal death including C-section (35.5\%) for antepartum haemorrhage and hysterectomy (17\%) for postpartum haemorrhage. For pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, only 12.5\% had C-section. Of all of the maternal deaths, only 2.5\% had assisted vaginal delivery and 14\% had puerperal sepsis. Conclusions: The observed maternal mortality ratio in this population is higher compared to the national average. Postpartum haemorrhage and preeclampsia/eclampsia remains to be the main direct causes of maternal deaths. Delay in decision making in seeking fortreatment and provision of treatment contributed to high maternal mortality observed in this study. This requires more effort to address the direct and indirect causes of maternal death.},

Methods: A descriptive retrospective review of hospital based maternal death data that occurred at Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center (KCMC) between the years 2003\textendash 2012. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the socio-demographic characteristics, causes and risk factors for maternal deaths using STATA version 12. Yearly maternal mortality ratio (MMR) was calculated to estimate the trend over years under the review. Results: Between years 2003\textendash 2012, a total of 34 953 live deliveries and 172 maternal deaths were recorded at KCMC, giving an overall MMR of 492.1/100 000 live deliveries. Direct causes accounted for 107 (62.2\%) of maternal deaths, indirect causes 49 (28.5\%) and 16 (9.3\%) were due to both direct and indirect causes. Hemorrhage was the overall leading cause of maternal death, accounting for 33 (19.2\%) of mortality, followed by hypertensive disorders in pregnancy 31 (18.0\%). HIV/AIDS and Heart diseases accounted for 8.7\% and 6.4\% of maternal deaths, and were the leading causes of indirect maternal deaths by contributing 31\% and 22\% respectively. Majority 67 (38.9\%) of deaths were attributed to type II delay followed by type I delay 59 (34.3\%). Conclusion: MMR is still very high in northern Tanzania with hemorrhage and hypertensive diseases the major preventable causes of deaths. Efforts must be made at the community, lower and tertiary health facilities to improve risk detection, management of risk cases to prevent severe forms of diseases and ensure timely referrals.},

Communicable and non-communicable diseases are increasing at an alarming rate and straining already overburdened and weak heath systems. Faced with a rapidly growing population, poorly equipped health workforce and meager resources to support the healthcare systems, there is a continuous search for tools to offer better healthcare in these resource constrained settings. ICT for development is one tool that has been adopted to improve access to quality healthcare for populations in resource constrained settings. While the tool has been shown to impact the health care sector positively, the use of ICT has brought in challenges of interoperability and usability of electronic systems in health. In this paper we investigate how Kenya has utilized ICT to spur development in the health sector and the measures she is undertaking to address these challenges. We advance that ICT for development is a tool that needs to be fully exploited by developing countries in order to bridge gaps in healthcare emanating from limited finances, poor infrastructure and an overstretched healthcare workforce.},

We illustrate our points by presenting some recent innovations in digital technologies for financing health care, identifying their contributions and their limits. Some examples include a mobile-health wallet application used in Kenya that encourages households to put money aside for future health expenses; an online software platform developed by a startup in Tanzania in partnership with a private insurance provider to give individuals and families the opportunity to choose among different health coverage options; and digital maps by a number of startups that bring together data on health facility locations and capacity, including equipment, staff, and types of services offered. We also sketch an agenda for future research and action for digital strategies for health financing. The development and adoption of effective solutions that align well with the universal health coverage agenda will require strong partnerships between stakeholders and enough proactive stewardship by authorities.},

  abstract = {Background Knowledge of antibiotic prescription practices in low- and middle-income countries is limited due to a lack of adequate surveillance systems. Objective To assess the prescription of antibiotics for the treatment of acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs) in primary care. Method An explanatory sequential mixed-methods study was conducted in 4 private not-for-profit outreach clinics located in slum areas in Nairobi, Kenya. Claims data of patients who received healthcare between April 1 and December 27, 2016 were collected in real-time through a mobile telephone-based healthcare data and payment exchange platform (branded as M-TIBA). These data were used to calculate the percentage of ARIs for which antibiotics were prescribed. In-depth interviews were conducted among 12 clinicians and 17 patients to explain the quantitative results. Results A total of 49,098 individuals were registered onto the platform, which allowed them to access healthcare at the study clinics through M-TIBA. For 36,210 clinic visits by 21,913 patients, 45,706 diagnoses and 85,484 medication prescriptions were recorded. ARIs were the most common diagnoses (17,739; 38.8\%), and antibiotics were the most frequently prescribed medications (21,870; 25.6\%). For 78.5\% (95\% CI: 77.9\%, 79.1\%) of ARI diagnoses, antibiotics were prescribed, most commonly amoxicillin (45\%; 95\% CI: 44.1\%, 45.8\%). These relatively high levels of prescription were explained by high patient load, clinician and patient perceptions that clinicians should prescribe, lack of access to laboratory tests, offloading near-expiry drugs, absence of policy and surveillance, and the use of treatment guidelines that are not up-to-date. Clinicians in contrast reported to strictly follow the Kenyan treatment guidelines. Conclusion This study showed successful quantification of antibiotic prescription and the prescribing pattern using real-world data collected through M-TIBA in private not-for-profit clinics in Nairobi.},

The publications discussed 13 technologies, of which 8 were for community-based surveillance, 2 were for facility-based surveillance, and 3 combined both forms of surveillance. Most of them were designed for reporting purposes and lacked interoperability features. While undoubtedly useful, the stand-alone character limits their impact on public health surveillance.},

One of the major challenges they face is how to efficiently reduce out-of-pocket spending. Health insurance systems are either inexistent or inefficient in many of these countries. In an attempt to implement and improve these systems, several countries have implemented mobile-supported health insurance systems (MHIS). Unfortunately, most of these programs have not crossed the pilot phases because of low adoption rates. Thus, this study sought to investigate the factors that influence the adoption of MHIS in LMIC. Using 263 valid responses collected during a 3-month survey in Cameroon, we found that coping appraisal and technology appraisal are important for the adoption of MHIS in LMIC. Precisely, performance expectancy, self-efficacy, response efficacy, facilitating conditions, and perceived cost explain 57.7\% of the variance in behavioral intention to adopt MHIS. This study is based on empirically tested factors founded on the protection motivation theory (PMT) and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT). Our contributions target health economists, technologists, policymakers, managers, researchers, and anyone interested in understanding the behavior of health insurance service consumers in LMIC and the pressures insurers and governments face during MHIS programs. We discuss the implications of our findings and further research that could help further explain MHIS adoption in LMIC.},

They are being used for a widening range of functions from diagnostics to health insurance to treatment advice, generating hopes for new healthcare futures and establishing the region as an emerging hub of experimentation in digital health. Drawing on our on-going ethnographic and anthropological research in Kenya and Tanzania, this article explores the dynamic, varied, experimental, and increasingly financialised terrain of formal digital health projects. While innovation in digital health is a growing feature of healthcare across the globe, in East Africa it is entering into a region already long characterised by NGOised, fragmented and vertical healthcare systems and heavy dependence on foreign capital. This presents challenges to efforts, including the WHO's Universal Health Coverage agenda, to foster national and equitable public healthcare systems. In exploring these issues, we recognise the power, and often deleterious effects, of financial capital that foregrounds markets in global digital health, but we also open space for a (still critical) recognition of East African-led digital and data technology movements.},

Method: A theoretical framework from literature on collective action theory, platform and business ecosystem concepts was developed to explain what factors influence interorganizational collective action for a common service platform. The framework was tested in a case study of collaborative platform project for independent living services in Finland. Semi-structured interviews with the project managers and the decision makers of involved organizations were the primary source of data collection. Result: Strikingly, interdependency among the organizations was not found to be important for collaboration in this case. Instead, we found that a central organization can play an important role in initiating, facilitating and encouraging collaboration among different parties. Moreover, we found more willingness for collaboration when the platform is aimed to be open to third-parties to complement the platform with additional services. Conclusions: Strategies of the platform leader and openness of the platform towards third parties are the most important drivers for collective action between organizations offering independent living services. Establishing common service platforms for independent living services requires explicit attention to these inter-organizational issues.},

The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist for reporting a systematic review or meta-analysis protocol was used to guide the screening and eligibility of the studies. The Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies was used to assess the quality of the studies while the Andersen framework was used to report findings. Results 74 studies that met the inclusion criteria were fully assessed. Most studies identified socioeconomic status, urban residence, older/increasing age, low parity, being educated and having an educated partner, being employed, being married and Christian religion as predictors of ANC attendance and timeliness. Awareness of danger signs, timing and adequate number of antenatal visits, exposure to mass media and good attitude towards ANC utilisation made attendance and initiation of ANC in first trimester more likely. Having an unplanned pregnancy, previous pregnancy complications, poor autonomy, lack of husband's support, increased distance to health facility, not having health insurance and high cost of services negatively impacted the overall uptake, timing and frequency of antenatal visits. Conclusion A variety of predisposing, enabling and need factors affect ANC utilisation in sub-Saharan Africa. Intersectoral collaboration to promote female education and empowerment, improve geographical access and strengthened implementation of ANC policies with active community participation are recommended.},

  abstract = {Clinical records capture the temporal, participatory, and interventional details of the care provision process. The exchange of these records plays a critical role in care continuity. Recently, there has been increasing attention on health data privacy and confidentiality which translates to questions on ownership and accessibility of clinical records. Traditional approaches to remedy this stand the risk of reducing the accessibility of these records, making care continuity across facilities more difficult. This poses a need for mechanisms that would enable the secure exchange of health data without adversely affecting the access to clinical records. This paper presents the Digital Health Wallet (DHW); a blockchain-enabled system that allows seamless clinical workflow orchestration and patient-mediated data exchange through consent management in a privacy-preserving manner. We conducted a preliminary test to benchmark the performance of DHW in resource-constrained healthcare facilities in developing countries.},

In order to realise this vision, the use-cases and implementations of Solid also require us to be consistent with the relevant privacy and data protection regulations such as the GDPR. However, to do so first requires a prior understanding of all actors, roles, and processes involved in a use-case, which then need to be aligned with GDPR's concepts to identify relevant obligations, and then investigate their compliance. To assist with this process, we describe Solid as a variation of `cloud technology' and adapt the existing standardised terminologies and paradigms from ISO/IEC standards. We then investigate the applicability of GDPR's requirements to Solid-based implementations, along with an exploration of how existing issues arising from GDPR enforcement also apply to Solid. Finally, we outline the path forward through specific extensions to Solid's specifications that mitigate known issues and enable the realisation of its benefits.},

A growing number of scholars see digital data and information commons as a way to counteract this asymmetry. In this paper I raise two concerns with this argument: First, because digital data and information can be in more than one place at once, governance models for physical common-pool resources cannot be easily transposed to digital commons. Second, not all data and information commons are suitable to address power differentials. In order to create digital commons that effectively address power asymmetries we must pay more systematic attention to the issue of exclusion from digital data and information commons. Why and how digital data and information commons exclude, and what the consequences of such exclusion are, decide whether commons can change power asymmetries or whether they are more likely to perpetuate them.},

The Program intended to bring high-quality care closer to more communities. Cutting across the Program was the routine collection of monitoring and evaluation data. The Program achieved significant reductions in maternal and perinatal mortality, a significant increase in the modern contraceptive prevalence rate, and a significant decline in the unmet need for contraception. By 2017, it was apparent that the Program was on track to meet or surpass many of the targets established by the Government of Tanzania. Over the following 2-plus years, efforts to sustain Program interventions intensified. In April 2019, the Program fully transitioned to Government of Tanzania oversight. Four key lessons were learned during implementation that are relevant to governments, donors, and implementing organizations working to reduce maternal mortality: (1) multistakeholder partnerships are critical; (2) demand creation for services, while critical, must rest on a foundation of well-functioning and high-quality clinical services; (3) it is imperative to not only collect robust monitoring and evaluation data, but to be responsive in real time to what the data reveal; and, (4) it is necessary to develop a deliberate sustainability strategy from the start. The Program in Kigoma demonstrates that decentralizing high-quality maternal and reproductive health services in remote, low-resource settings is both feasible and effective and should be considered in places with similar contexts. By embedding the Program in the existing health system, and through efforts to build local capacity, the improvements seen in Kigoma are likely to be sustained. Follow-up evaluations are planned, providing an opportunity to more directly assess sustainability.},

Information systems research on digital platforms for the health sector has focused more on healthcare. Less research exists on health insurance. This study, therefore, addresses the research gap by focusing on digital platform for national health insurance service in a developing country. The study employs qualitative, interpretive case study as methodology and institutional theory as analytical lens to investigate regulative, normative, and cultural-cognitive institutional effects on digital platform development and use for national health insurance in Ghana. The findings show the institutional enablers as: (1) health-seeking culture; (2) mobile network penetration and use; and (3) appropriate laws and regulations. Conversely, the constraints are (1) Unstructured supplementary service data (USSD) functionality; and (2) extended family system.},

  abstract = {Background The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of making research data from all German hospitals available to scientists to respond to current and future pandemics promptly. The heterogeneous data originating from proprietary systems at hospitals' sites must be harmonized and accessible. The German Corona Consensus Dataset (GECCO) specifies how data for COVID-19 patients will be standardized in Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) profiles across German hospitals. However, given the complexity of the FHIR standard, the data harmonization is not sufficient to make the data accessible. A simplified visual representation is needed to reduce the technical burden, while allowing feasibility queries. Objective This study investigates how a search ontology can be automatically generated using FHIR profiles and a terminology server. Furthermore, it describes how this ontology can be used in a user interface (UI) and how a mapping and a terminology tree created together with the ontology can translate user input into FHIR queries. Methods We used the FHIR profiles from the GECCO data set combined with a terminology server to generate an ontology and the required mapping files for the translation. We analyzed the profiles and identified search criteria for the visual representation. In this process, we reduced the complex profiles to code value pairs for improved usability. We enriched our ontology with the necessary information to display it in a UI. We also developed an intermediate query language to transform the queries from the UI to federated FHIR requests. Separation of concerns resulted in discrepancies between the criteria used in the intermediate query format and the target query language. Therefore, a mapping was created to reintroduce all information relevant for creating the query in its target language. Further, we generated a tree representation of the ontology hierarchy, which allows resolving child concepts in the process. Results In the scope of this project, 82 (99\%) of 83 elements defined in the GECCO profile were successfully implemented. We verified our solution based on an independently developed test patient. A discrepancy between the test data and the criteria was found in 6 cases due to different versions used to generate the test data and the UI profiles, the support for specific code systems, and the evaluation of postcoordinated Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) codes. Our results highlight the need for governance mechanisms for version changes, concept mapping between values from different code systems encoding the same concept, and support for different unit dimensions. Conclusions We developed an automatic process to generate ontology and mapping files for FHIR-formatted data. Our tests found that this process works for most of our chosen FHIR profile criteria. The process established here works directly with FHIR profiles and a terminology server, making it extendable to other FHIR profiles and demonstrating that automatic ontology generation on FHIR profiles is feasible.},

  abstract = {In Kenya, early coronavirus disease (COVID-19) modeling studies predicted that disruptions in antenatal care and hospital services could increase indirect maternal and neonatal deaths and stillbirths. As the Kenyan government enforced lockdowns and a curfew, many mothers-to-be were unable to safely reach hospital facilities, especially at night. Fear of contracting COVID-19, increasing costs of accessing care, stigma, and falling incomes forced many expectant mothers to give birth at home. MomCare, which primarily serves communities in remote areas and urban slums, links mothers-to-be with payers and health care providers, following a standardized pregnancy program based on World Health Organization guidelines at a predetermined cost and quality. Expectant mothers gain access to care through a mobile wallet on their feature phone (voice, text, and basic internet), and providers are paid after appropriate care is given. Within the first 3 weeks of the pandemic in Kenya, the following services were added to the MomCare bundle: emergency ambulance services during curfew hours, extended bed allowances to encourage early care, phone calls to check on mothers approaching their delivery dates and to promote the generation of a birth plan, SMS messages to inform mothers of open facilities and COVID-19 protocols, and training for clinic staff in managing COVID-19 patients and infection prevention. We compare data collected through the MomCare platform during the 6 months before the first confirmed COVID-19 case in Kenya (September 2019\textendash February 2020) with data collected during the 6 months that followed. This study shows that care-seeking behaviors (enrollment, antenatal/postnatal care, skilled deliveries) increased for mothers-to-be enrolled in MomCare during the COVID-19 lockdowns, while quality of care and outcomes were maintained. Public health practitioners can promote interactive, patient-driven technology like MomCare to augment traditional responses, quickly linking payments with patients and providers in times of crisis.},

In low- and middle-income country (LMIC) settings, this model could be adapted to address low antenatal care uptake and improve quality. However, evidence on key attributes of a group care model for low-resource settings remains scant. We conducted a systematic review of the published literature on models of group antenatal care in LMICs to identify attributes that may increase the relevance, acceptability and effectiveness of group ANC in such settings. We systematically searched five databases and conducted hand and reference searches. We also conducted key informant interviews with researchers and program implementers who have introduced group antenatal care models in LMICs. Using a pre-defined evidence summary template, we extracted evidence on key attributes\textemdash like session content and frequency, and group composition and organization\textemdash of group care models introduced across LMIC settings. Our systematic literature review identified nine unique descriptions of group antenatal care models. We supplemented this information with evidence from 10 key informant interviews. We synthesized evidence from these 19 data sources to identify attributes of group care models for pregnant women that appeared consistently across all of them. We considered these components that are fundamental to the delivery of group antenatal care. We also identified attributes that need to be tailored to the context in which they are implemented to meet local standards for comprehensive ANC, for example, the number of sessions and the session content. We compiled these attributes to codify a composite ``generic'' model of group antenatal care for adaptation and implementation in LMIC settings. With this combination of standard and flexible components, group antenatal care, a service delivery alternative that has been successfully introduced and implemented in high-income country settings, can be adapted for improving provision and experiences of care for pregnant women in LMIC. Any conclusions about the benefits of this model for women, babies, and health systems in LMICs, however, must be based on robust evaluations of group antenatal care programs in those settings.},

This `Googlization of health research' (`GHR') begs the question of how the common good will be served in this research. As critical data scholars contend, such phenomena must be situated within the political economy of digital capitalism in order to foreground the question of public interest and the common good. Here, trends like GHR are framed within a double, incommensurable logic, where private gain and economic value are pitted against public good and societal value. While helpful for highlighting the exploitative potential of digital capitalism, this framing is limiting, insofar as it acknowledges only one conception of the common good. This article uses the analytical framework of modes of justification developed by Boltanksi and Th\'evenot to identify a plurality of orders of worth and conceptualizations of the common good at work in GHR. Not just the `civic' (doing good for society) and `market' (enhancing wealth creation) orders, but also an `industrial' (increasing efficiency), a `project' (innovation and experimentation), and what I call a `vitalist' (proliferating life) order. Using promotional material of GHR initiatives and preliminary interviews with participants in GHR projects, I ask what moral orientations guide different actors in GHR. Engaging seriously with these different conceptions of the common good is paramount. First, in order to critically evaluate them and explicate what is at stake in the move towards GHR, and ultimately, in order to develop viable governance solutions that ensure strong `civic' components.},

Early identification of sepsis is important as it allows timely administration of potentially life-saving resuscitation and antimicrobial therapy. We present COMPOSER (COnformal Multidimensional Prediction Of SEpsis Risk), a deep learning model for the early prediction of sepsis, specifically designed to reduce false alarms by detecting unfamiliar patients/situations arising from erroneous data, missingness, distributional shift and data drifts. COMPOSER flags these unfamiliar cases as indeterminate rather than making spurious predictions. Six patient cohorts (515,720 patients) curated from two healthcare systems in the United States across intensive care units (ICU) and emergency departments (ED) were used to train and externally and temporally validate this model. In a sequential prediction setting, COMPOSER achieved a consistently high area under the curve (AUC) (ICU: 0.925\textendash 0.953; ED: 0.938\textendash 0.945). Out of over 6 million prediction windows roughly 20\% and 8\% were identified as indeterminate amongst non-septic and septic patients, respectively. COMPOSER provided early warning within a clinically actionable timeframe (ICU: 12.2 [3.2 22.8] and ED: 2.1 [0.8 4.5] hours prior to first antibiotics order) across all six cohorts, thus allowing for identification and prioritization of patients at high risk for sepsis.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Increasing knowledge on obstetric danger signs (DS) among pregnant women and their families is one of the interventions targeted to reduce maternal and newborn mortality. It is expected that knowledge in DS will lead to early care seeking once complications occur among women or newborns. Health care providers are required to educate women on DS of obstetric emergency during pregnancy, delivery and immediate-post-delivery. This study aimed to determine the level of knowledge on danger signs among rural women and its effect on antenatal care visits, birth preparedness and complication readiness (BPCR) and on use of skilled birth attendance (SBA) during childbirth. METHODS: community-based analytical cross-sectional study was conducted in July 2019 among women who delivered in the past 24 months in two wards at Babati Rural district, Tanzania. Questionnaire was used for data collection. Odds Ratio was used to assess association between knowledge on danger signs with use of services during pregnancy and childbirth. RESULTS: a total of 372 women were enrolled, with mean age of 28.5 years (S.D 7.2). All the women attended antenatal care at least once during pregnancy, 65.3\% attended ANC 4 or more visits, 85.2\% of women were assisted by SBA during childbirth, and 13.7\% of the women had birth preparedness and complication readiness plan. Overall, 272 (73.1\%) women reported that they were counseled about obstetric danger signs during antenatal clinic visits, but only 32\% could mention three or more DS of obstetric and newborn emergency. Overall good knowledge of DS and knowledge of obstetric danger signs during pregnancy were significantly associated with 4 or more ANC visits and birth preparedness and complication readiness but not with SBA use during childbirth. CONCLUSION: majority of women were counseled on DS during pregnancy, however more than three quarters (68\%) had low knowledge. Women who were knowledgeable on danger signs during pregnancy attended 4+ ANC visits and prepared for birth and its complications. There is a need of designing alternative models of engaging women during education/ counseling sessions so that they may have a higher retention of knowledge not only of danger signs but for other maternal and newborn health issues.},

  abstract = {Background To accelerate universal health coverage, Nigeria's National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) decentralized the implementation of government health insurance to the individual states in 2014. Lagos is one of the states that passed a State Health Insurance Scheme into law, in order to expand the benefits of health insurance beyond the few residents enrolled in community-based health insurance programs, commercial private health insurance plans or the NHIS. Public and private healthcare providers are a critical component of the Lagos State Health Scheme (LSHS) rollout. This study explored the determinants and perception of provider participation in health insurance programs including the LSHS. Methods This study used a mixed-methods cross sectional design. Quantitative data were collected from 60 healthcare facilities representatively sampled from 6 Local Government Areas in Lagos state. For the qualitative data, providers were interviewed using structured questionnaires on selected characteristics of each health facility in addition to the managers' opinions about the challenges and benefits of insurance participation, capacity pressure, resource availability and financial management consequences. Results A higher proportion of provider facilities participating in insurance relative to non-participating facilities were larger with mid to (very) high patient volume, workforce, and longer years of operation. In addition, a greater proportion of private facilities compared to public facilities participated in insurance. Furthermore, a higher proportion of secondary and tertiary facilities relative to primary facilities participated in insurance. Lastly, increase in patient volume and revenue were motivating factors for provider facilities to participate in insurance, while low tariffs, delay and denial of payments, and patients' unrealistic expectations were mentioned as inhibiting factors. Conclusion For the Lagos state and other government insurance schemes in developing countries to be successful, effective contracting and quality assurance of healthcare providers are essential. The health facilities indicated that these would require adequate and regular provider payment, investments in infrastructure upgrades and educating the public about insurance benefit plans and service expectations.},

  abstract = {Background Sharing health data is challenging because of several technical, ethical, and regulatory issues. The Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) guiding principles have been conceptualized to enable data interoperability. Many studies provide implementation guidelines, assessment metrics, and software to achieve FAIR-compliant data, especially for health data sets. Health Level 7 (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is a health data content modeling and exchange standard. Objective Our goal was to devise a new methodology to extract, transform, and load existing health data sets into HL7 FHIR repositories in line with FAIR principles, develop a Data Curation Tool to implement the methodology, and evaluate it on health data sets from 2 different but complementary institutions. We aimed to increase the level of compliance with FAIR principles of existing health data sets through standardization and facilitate health data sharing by eliminating the associated technical barriers. Methods Our approach automatically processes the capabilities of a given FHIR end point and directs the user while configuring mappings according to the rules enforced by FHIR profile definitions. Code system mappings can be configured for terminology translations through automatic use of FHIR resources. The validity of the created FHIR resources can be automatically checked, and the software does not allow invalid resources to be persisted. At each stage of our data transformation methodology, we used particular FHIR-based techniques so that the resulting data set could be evaluated as FAIR. We performed a data-centric evaluation of our methodology on health data sets from 2 different institutions. Results Through an intuitive graphical user interface, users are prompted to configure the mappings into FHIR resource types with respect to the restrictions of selected profiles. Once the mappings are developed, our approach can syntactically and semantically transform existing health data sets into HL7 FHIR without loss of data utility according to our privacy-concerned criteria. In addition to the mapped resource types, behind the scenes, we create additional FHIR resources to satisfy several FAIR criteria. According to the data maturity indicators and evaluation methods of the FAIR Data Maturity Model, we achieved the maximum level (level 5) for being Findable, Accessible, and Interoperable and level 3 for being Reusable. Conclusions We developed and extensively evaluated our data transformation approach to unlock the value of existing health data residing in disparate data silos to make them available for sharing according to the FAIR principles. We showed that our method can successfully transform existing health data sets into HL7 FHIR without loss of data utility, and the result is FAIR in terms of the FAIR Data Maturity Model. We support institutional migration to HL7 FHIR, which not only leads to FAIR data sharing but also eases the integration with different research networks.},

  abstract = {The task of similarity search is widely used in various areas of computing, including multimedia databases, data mining, bioinformatics, social networks, etc. In fact, retrieval of semantically unstructured data entities requires a form of aggregated qualification that selects entities relevant to a query. A popular type of such a mechanism is similarity querying. For a long time, the database-oriented applications of similarity search employed the definition of similarity restricted to metric distances. Due to its topological properties, metric similarity can be effectively used to index a database which can then be queried efficiently by so-called metric access methods. However, together with the increasing complexity of data entities across various domains, in recent years there appeared many similarities that were not metrics\textemdash we call them nonmetric similarity functions. In this article we survey domains employing nonmetric functions for effective similarity search, and methods for efficient nonmetric similarity search. First, we show that the ongoing research in many of these domains requires complex representations of data entities. Simultaneously, such complex representations allow us to model also complex and computationally expensive similarity functions (often represented by various matching algorithms). However, the more complex similarity function one develops, the more likely it will be a nonmetric. Second, we review state-of-the-art techniques for efficient (fast) nonmetric similarity search, concerning both exact and approximate search. Finally, we discuss some open problems and possible future research trends.},

One of the main ways of achieving normalization and standardization is the use of Knowledge Graphs. A Knowledge Graph captures concepts and their relationships for a specific domain, but their creation is time-consuming and requires manual intervention from domain experts, which can prove expensive. SNOMED CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine -- Clinical Terms), Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), and Gene Ontology (GO) are popular ontologies from the healthcare domain. SNOMED CT and UMLS capture concepts such as disease, symptoms and diagnosis and GO is the world's largest source of information on the functions of genes. Healthcare has been dealing with an explosion in information about different types of drugs, diseases, and procedures. This paper argues that using Knowledge Graphs is not the best solution for solving problems in this domain. We present experiments using LLMs for the healthcare domain to demonstrate that language models provide the same functionality as knowledge graphs, thereby making knowledge graphs redundant.},

  abstract = {Background Despite the great impact of information and communication technologies on clinical practice and on the quality of health services, this trend has been almost exclusive to developed countries, whereas countries with poor resources suffer from many economic and social issues that have hindered the real benefits of electronic health (eHealth) tools. As a component of eHealth systems, electronic health records (EHRs) play a fundamental role in patient management and effective medical care services. Thus, the adoption of EHRs in regions with a lack of infrastructure, untrained staff, and ill-equipped health care providers is an important task. However, the main barrier to adopting EHR software in low- and middle-income countries is the cost of its purchase and maintenance, which highlights the open-source approach as a good solution for these underserved areas. Objective The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review of open-source EHR systems based on the requirements and limitations of low-resource settings. Methods First, we reviewed existing literature on the comparison of available open-source solutions. In close collaboration with the University of Gondar Hospital, Ethiopia, we identified common limitations in poor resource environments and also the main requirements that EHRs should support. Then, we extensively evaluated the current open-source EHR solutions, discussing their strengths and weaknesses, and their appropriateness to fulfill a predefined set of features relevant for low-resource settings. Results The evaluation methodology allowed assessment of several key aspects of available solutions that are as follows: (1) integrated applications, (2) configurable reports, (3) custom reports, (4) custom forms, (5) interoperability, (6) coding systems, (7) authentication methods, (8) patient portal, (9) access control model, (10) cryptographic features, (11) flexible data model, (12) offline support, (13) native client, (14) Web client,(15) other clients, (16) code-based language, (17) development activity, (18) modularity, (19) user interface, (20) community support, and (21) customization. The quality of each feature is discussed for each of the evaluated solutions and a final comparison is presented. Conclusions There is a clear demand for open-source, reliable, and flexible EHR systems in low-resource settings. In this study, we have evaluated and compared five open-source EHR systems following a multidimensional methodology that can provide informed recommendations to other implementers, developers, and health care professionals. We hope that the results of this comparison can guide decision making when needing to adopt, install, and maintain an open-source EHR solution in low-resource settings.},

Despite the increasing number of solutions based on the openEHR specifications, it is difficult to find publicly available healthcare datasets in the openEHR format that can be used to test, compare and validate different data persistence mechanisms for openEHR. To foster research on openEHR servers, we present the openEHR Benchmark Dataset, ORBDA, a very large healthcare benchmark dataset encoded using the openEHR formalism. To construct ORBDA, we extracted and cleaned a de-identified dataset from the Brazilian National Healthcare System (SUS) containing hospitalisation and high complexity procedures information and formalised it using a set of openEHR archetypes and templates. Then, we implemented a tool to enrich the raw relational data and convert it into the openEHR model using the openEHR Java reference model library. The ORBDA dataset is available in composition, versioned composition and EHR openEHR representations in XML and JSON formats. In total, the dataset contains more than 150 million composition records. We describe the dataset and provide means to access it. Additionally, we demonstrate the usage of ORBDA for evaluating inserting throughput and query latency performances of some NoSQL database management systems. We believe that ORBDA is a valuable asset for assessing storage models for openEHR-based information systems during the software engineering process. It may also be a suitable component in future standardised benchmarking of available openEHR storage platforms.},

However, inequities remain, and many children and adolescents are still not covered by life-saving and nurturing care interventions, despite their relatively low costs and high cost-effectiveness. This Series paper builds on a large body of work from the past two decades on evidence-based interventions and packages of care for survival, strategies for delivery, and platforms to reach the most vulnerable. We review the current evidence base on the effectiveness of a variety of essential and emerging interventions that can be delivered from before conception until age 20 years to help children and adolescents not only survive into adulthood, but also to grow and develop optimally, support their wellbeing, and help them reach their full developmental potential. Although scaling up evidence-based interventions in children younger than 5 years might have the greatest effect on reducing child mortality rates, we highlight interventions and evidence gaps for school-age children (5\textendash 9 years) and the transition from childhood to adolescence (10\textendash 19 years), including interventions to support mental health and positive development, and address unintentional injuries, neglected tropical diseases, and non-communicable diseases.},

  abstract = {Background: The standard Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is widely used in health information technology. However, its use as a standard for health research is still less prevalent. To use existing data sources more efficiently for health research, data interoperability becomes increasingly important. FHIR provides solutions by offering resource domains such as ``Public Health \&amp; Research'' and ``Evidence-Based Medicine'' while using already established web technologies. Therefore, FHIR could help standardize data across different data sources and improve interoperability in health research. Objective: The aim of our study was to provide a systematic review of existing literature and determine the current state of FHIR implementations in health research and possible future directions. Methods: We searched the PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and Cochrane Library databases for studies published from 2011 to 2022. Studies investigating the use of FHIR in health research were included. Articles published before 2011, abstracts, reviews, editorials, and expert opinions were excluded. We followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines and registered this study with PROSPERO (CRD42021235393). Data synthesis was done in tables and figures. Results: We identified a total of 998 studies, of which 49 studies were eligible for inclusion. Of the 49 studies, most (73\%, n=36) covered the domain of clinical research, whereas the remaining studies focused on public health or epidemiology (6\%, n=3) or did not specify their research domain (20\%, n=10). Studies used FHIR for data capture (29\%, n=14), standardization of data (41\%, n=20), analysis (12\%, n=6), recruitment (14\%, n=7), and consent management (4\%, n=2). Most (55\%, 27/49) of the studies had a generic approach, and 55\% (12/22) of the studies focusing on specific medical specialties (infectious disease, genomics, oncology, environmental health, imaging, and pulmonary hypertension) reported their solutions to be conferrable to other use cases. Most (63\%, 31/49) of the studies reported using additional data models or terminologies: Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (29\%, n=14), Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (37\%, n=18), International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (18\%, n=9), Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership common data model (12\%, n=6), and others (43\%, n=21). Only 4 (8\%) studies used a FHIR resource from the domain ``Public Health \&amp; Research.'' Limitations using FHIR included the possible change in the content of FHIR resources, safety, legal matters, and the need for a FHIR server. Conclusions: Our review found that FHIR can be implemented in health research, and the areas of application are broad and generalizable in most use cases. The implementation of international terminologies was common, and other standards such as the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership common data model could be used as a complement to FHIR. Limitations such as the change of FHIR content, lack of FHIR implementation, safety, and legal matters need to be addressed in future releases to expand the use of FHIR and, therefore, interoperability in health research.},

  abstract = {Blockchain solutions offer efficient approaches for trustworthy data management, especially in the medical field when storing and processing sensitive patient data. Many institutional and industrial facilities have already recognized the importance of the technology for the health sector and have also formulated basic ideas, concepts and main use cases, but concrete implementations and executions are comparatively rare. This mini review examines current research on specific blockchain implementations in healthcare that go beyond the state of concept studies or theoretical implementation ideas and describes the most promising systems based on systematic literature research. The review shows that secure storage and easy access to complete patient data is becoming increasingly important. Blockchain technology can be used as a secure, transparent and digital way to meet these needs. Hybrid solutions consisting of conventional data storage and blockchain-based access management are increasingly being developed and implemented. The automation of blockchain processes through smart contracts is also recommended. The review further reveals ambiguities in the use of permissioned and permissionless blockchain frameworks, machine learning (ML) integration as well as the question of which data should be stored in the blockchain and how this should be viewed legally. Therefore, there is still a need for further research, especially on these aspects, in order to further establish the use of blockchains in healthcare.}

Artificial Intelligence, including Machine Learning and more specifically Deep Learning, has made amazing advances over the past decade. Significant resources are now dedicated to problems in the field of medicine, but with the potential to further the digital divide by neglecting underserved areas and their specific context. In the general case, Deep Learning remains a complex technology requiring deep technical expertise. This paper explores advances within the narrower field of deep learning image analysis that reduces barriers to adoption and allows individuals with less specialized software skills to effectively employ these techniques. This enables a next wave of innovation, driven largely by problem domain expertise and the creative application of this technology to unaddressed concerns in LMIC settings. The paper also explores the central role of NGOs in problem identification, data acquisition and curation, and integration of new technologies into healthcare systems.},

Recognizing that high quality metadata are essential to make datasets FAIR, members of the GO FAIR Initiative and the Research Data Alliance (RDA) have initiated a series of workshops to encourage the creation of Metadata for Machines (M4M), enabling any self-identified stakeholder to define and promote the reuse of standardized, comprehensive machine-actionable metadata. The funders of scientific research recognize that they have an important role to play in ensuring that experimental results are FAIR, and that high quality metadata and careful planning for FAIR data stewardship are central to these goals. We describe the outcome of a recent M4M workshop that has led to a pilot programme involving two national science funders, the Health Research Board of Ireland (HRB) and the Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development (ZonMW). These funding organizations will explore new technologies to define at the time that a request for proposals is issued the minimal set of machine-actionable metadata that they would like investigators to use to annotate their datasets, to enable investigators to create such metadata to help make their data FAIR, and to develop data-stewardship plans that ensure that experimental data will be managed appropriately abiding by the FAIR principles. The FAIR Funders design envisions a data-management workflow having seven essential stages, where solution providers are openly invited to participate. The initial pilot programme will launch using existing computer-based tools of those who attended the M4M Workshop.}

  abstract = {The emergence of Internet protocol suites and packet-switching technologies tends to the considerations of security, privacy, scalability, and reliability in layered Internet service architectures. The existing service systems allow us to access big data, but few studies focus on the fundamental security and stability in these systems, especially when they involve large-scale networks with overloaded private information. In this paper, we explored the blockchain-based mechanism that aims to improve the critical features of traditional Internet services, including autonomous and decentralized processing, smart contractual enforcement of goals, and traceable trustworthiness in tamper-proof transactions. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive review to conceptualize the blockchain-based framework to develop the decentralized protocols for the extensive number of Internet services. This comprehensive survey aims to address blockchain integration to secure Internet services and identify the critical requirements of developing a decentralized trustworthy Internet service. Additionally, we present a case study of the blockchain-based Internet of Things (IoT) for neuro-informatics to illustrate the potential applications of blockchain architectures. Finally, we summarize the trends and challenges of blockchain architectures that benefit a multitude of disciplines across all the Internet service fields of interest.},
